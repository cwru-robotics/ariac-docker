osrf/ariac-docker base: master

our edits to ariac-docker:

*in /team_config, create a folder: team_case
 our changes will only be in this folder

  in team_case, we edit build_team_system.bash, run_team_system.bash team_config.yaml

  run_team_system should include:
      roslaunch cwru_launch cwru_ariac.launch  (create this!!)

  build_team_system.bash:
    





*in trial_config, put examples to be tested,
  e.g. sample.yaml, ... (we should put all examples here)

then can: ./run_trial.bash team_case sample
  (e.g. to run sample.yaml)


from: 
~/ariac_ws/ariac-docker

do:
run_trial.bash

here is my github code:

b7f24337179a24b4f3cfb537833eccbdf5bec9a7

goes in build_team_system.bash:  https://github.com/cwru-robotics/cwru_ariac_2019.git


git clone https://b7f24337179a24b4f3cfb537833eccbdf5bec9a7@github.com/cwru-robotics/cwru_ariac_2019.git


-----
  to test, run:   ./build_team_system.bash
  then run: ./run_trial.bash  (or other run bash trial)
